## 🙋‍♂️ About Me
  
  Greetings, my name is Hazhiyah Yumni. I started from my curiosity about how to create and use an application for everyone needs. I also continue training related to website development and presently learning about android development. I am currently studying with a degree in Information Systems at Malikussaleh University. I would love to analyzing system requirements from several references into something that more structured.
